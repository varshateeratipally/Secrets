Secrets Web Application
This web application, built with Express.js, provides a simple mechanism for password-protected access to a secret page. Users initially land on a login page where they must enter the correct password to gain access to the secrets page. The application uses Node.js with Express for server-side operations, utilizing a basic HTML form for user input. The password verification is handled by a middleware function that checks if the entered password matches the predefined value ("ILoveProgramming"). If the password is correct, the application allows the user to proceed to the secret page.

To run the application, you first need to install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Once the setup is complete, start the server by running node index.js and open a browser to navigate to http://localhost:3006. The application structure includes index.js as the main server file and two HTML files: public/index.html for the login page and public/secret.html for the secret page. The routes are straightforward, with a GET request serving the login page and a POST request validating the password to display the appropriate page. The project relies on Express for routing and body-parser middleware for parsing request bodies.
